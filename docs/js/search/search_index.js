Or for those who don't speak tap why is it so extra. Why is there quite so much code and supporting infrastructure for what could be implemented quite simply? Well as I don't have a lot of time to work on this then I wanted anything I built to be easy to support and maintain. If you would like to know more about the sights, the sounds... the smells... of the technologies I use then please feel free to check out the Technölogy Stäck page.\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nIt's really easy to get started with NG-Guitar.\nPrerequisites\nThese components are currently built for use on top of Angular Material and TypeScript. You'll need to have a project based on this tech stack in order to use them.\n\n\nFor Component Consumers\nThis is a new project under active development. There will be refactoring! The intention is once the components reach a suitable level of maturity they will be published as packages. If you are interested in checking out progress and how they are evolving see the Storybook or Compodoc pages\nWhen the components are published as packages, we will add instructions here so you will be able to use them in your own projects.\nExamples of the Components in use and the latest Demo can be found here.\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nFor Contributors\nThis instructions below describe on setting up your project locally.\nTo get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.\nContributing\nContributions, issues and feat requests are welcome!\nInstall\nnpm install --legacy-peer-depsUsage\nnpm run startRun tests\nnpm run testCommitting\nSee Commit Rules\nFeel free to check issues page.\n(back to top)\n\nVision\nI find it difficult to keep focus when practicing the guitar scales and patterns that make up the foundations of improvisation. I seem to be switching between tinkering with the metronome, referring to reference materials for whatever I'm learning to practice. trying to track how long I've been practicing any one thing and my overall progress, so I know what weak spots to focus on.\nThis seems like a good candidate for an app, in fact I can think of a few different guitar-based apps that don't seem to currently exist, so the plan here is to build the elements of this as re-usable components and then later make those components available as packages.\nThe aim is that the initial app will provide a metronome that can be configured to accelerate to help speed training. This will have a scrolling tab display linked to it which will suggest patterns to practice. These patterns will evolve in complexity over time. The app should track how long you have been practicing and suggest regular breaks to avoid repetitive strain injuries.\nThe app should take advantage of what psychological research about learning shows us and feature on one pattern to learn, switch to another then switch back to re-enforce the learning of the patterns.\nIt would great as a future enhancement if note recognition could be integrated so the application can give feedback and give better automatic control of progression through increasingly complex exercises.\n(back to top)\n\nRoadmap\n\n feat: Accurate Typescript Metronome Component\n chore: setup dependabot\n ci: add commitlint to enforce conventioanl commits\n feat: add storybook and compodoc\n feat(scroller): simple animated tab scroller\n feat(fretboard): Show notes in key\n feat(fretboard): chord pattern visualization component\n feat(fretboard): refactor fretboard to be closer to material list\n feat(fretboard): refactor fretboard to support left handed users\n feat(fretboard): refactor fretboard to support responsive design\n feat(fretboard): implement material theming\n feat(fretboard): highlight notes from key\n feat(demo): add theme switching to demo\n feat(scroller): add theme switching to demo\n feat(docs): add https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic/\n feat(metronome): SVG based metronome visulisation component\n chore(ci): refactor ci pipeline to only build affected\n chore(ci): add semver and changelog generation\n feat(demo): getting started page for consumers\n feat(demo):about, version and dependency display\n feat(metronome): speed trainer i.e. define min max range, incrementally accellerate\n feat(feedback): experimental in browser ML note recognition\n feat(etude): practice pattern generator\n\n(back to top)\n\nBugs and Refactor\n\n fix: bind tempo to tempo not tickcount\n fix: svg header/footer background path when publishing to subdirectory\n fix(docs): storybook material theming\n fix(fretboard): fretmarkers do not respect number of frets\n fix(demo): dead menu space on initial load\n fix(ci): semver numbering not written back to main package.json\n\n(back to top)\n\nShow your support\nGive a ⭐️ if this project helped you!\n(back to top)\n\n📝 License\nCopyright © 2022 T.D.Morris.\nThis project is MIT licensed.\n(back to top)\n\nAuthor\n👤 TimDMorris\n\nWebsite: https://cambridgemonorail.github.io/ng-guitar/\nTwitter: @TimDMorris\nGithub: @TimDMorris\nLinkedIn: @timdmorris\n\n(back to top)\n\nInspired By\n\nfretboard - By Robert Pirtle\ntonaljs / tonal\n\n(back to top)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAngular Material\nreadme-md-generator\nGitHub Profile Badges\n\n(back to top)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Tim Morris\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
